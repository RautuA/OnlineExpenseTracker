## Online Expense Tracker

This project is an **Online Expense Tracker** designed to help users manage their finances by tracking income and expenses through a web-based application. It is built using a combination of **Java** technologies and follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Servlets**: Handles server-side logic and user requests.
- **Hibernate**: An ORM framework that facilitates seamless database interactions.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: Generates dynamic content and renders the web pages.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores user data and expense records.
- **Bootstrap**: A frontend framework for building responsive and mobile-friendly interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling of the web pages.

### Project Structure:
- `/src`: Contains the Java Servlets and DAO (Data Access Object) classes.
- `/WebContent`: Includes the JSP files and static resources like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `hibernate.cfg.xml`: Configuration file for Hibernate, which sets up the connection to the MySQL database.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RautuA/online-expense-tracker.git
   ```
2. Set up a MySQL database and update the configuration details in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file (e.g., database URL, username, and password).
3. Build the project using your preferred IDE or a build tool like **Maven**.
4. Deploy the project to a servlet container, such as **Apache Tomcat**.
5. Access the application via a web browser, register an account, and start tracking your expenses.
